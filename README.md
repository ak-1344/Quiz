# 🎉 Fun Quiz Web App

This is a playful, light-hearted quiz web app where users answer fun questions and get hilarious, teasing responses based on their choices. Perfect for roasting friends with love! ❤️

## 📝 Project Overview

The app asks a series of 10 playful and funny questions, and for each answer, it provides an entertaining response. At the end, it displays the user's name and their selected answers.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```
📂 project-folder
├── 📄 index.html              # The frontend HTML for the quiz
├── 📄 style.css               # Tailwind CSS for styling
├── 📄 script.js               # JavaScript for quiz logic
```

## 💻 How It Works

1. **User enters their name**: The app personalizes the experience by greeting the user with their name.
2. **Fun questions appear one by one**: Users select their answers from multiple-choice options.
3. **Playful responses**: After selecting an option, a fun response appears.
4. **Final message**: Once all questions are answered, the app shows a summary of the user's responses.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser.

## 🌈 Styling

This project uses **Tailwind CSS** for modern, responsive styling. Buttons and text elements have smooth transitions and hover effects.

## 🧠 Key JavaScript Functions

- `startQuiz()` — Starts the quiz, takes the user’s name, and shows questions.
- `nextQuestion()` — Navigates through the questions and shows the next one.
- `getOptions()` — Generates and displays multiple-choice answers for each question.
- `handleClick()` — Captures the user’s answer and shows the corresponding fun response.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If things don’t work as expected:
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly linked in `index.html`.
- Make sure JavaScript (`script.js`) is loaded and placed at the end of the HTML body.
